The example 1 scala code taken from chapter 9 reads the file assaults-2015-csv and 
creates a Spark SQL temporary table. The three example SQL files select data from 
that table so that Zeppelin graphs can be created using the data. 

The Influx  file contains the commands needed to set up the database and table and 
populate it with data. 

The Zepelin JSON file just contains the simple JSON file used within DCOS to install 
the Zeppelin framework.
